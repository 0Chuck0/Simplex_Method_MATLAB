Update the Find_MRV function
It does not handle the case where the MRV becomes negative
To counter it just set the MRV value of that very high like INT_MAX or something
Here is the updated MRV function

function output =  find_mrv(Table_1,b,idx)
    %taking i+1 as the first row is cost row(Zj - Cj)
    mrv = zeros([1 size(b,1)]);
    for i=1:size(b,1)
        mrv(i) = Table_1(i+1,6)/Table_1(i+1,idx);
        if (mrv(i) < 0 )
            mrv(i) = 999999;
        end
    end

    output = transpose(mrv);
end
